    <string name="text_for_dounload_page">I suppose to use Android Pay API. According a tutorial Android API is a part of Google Play Services. So first I need to add some dependencies in a build.gradle. Google provides it in a site. Then I need to change a manifestÂ file and add services tags. After I will go to my layout.xml file and add payment button(or buttons) using a frame layout. Then in the MainActivity.java I need to implement some code. I found some examples of implementation and going to do some experiments.

    <string name="text_for_main_text">Here I am going to add the last second songs that user listening. Maybe in future, I will change numbers of songs. And that will be more that 2 last. I still not sure in what way I will implement it. Need more time and experience for it. Images are here only to cover an empty space.

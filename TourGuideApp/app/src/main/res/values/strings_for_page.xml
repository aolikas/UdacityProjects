        A huge part of ancient buildings in Hamburg was destroyed during war, but the main sight and the symbol of the city  Michelle Tower of St Michael Church
        that is 132 m high  was almost not affected.</string>
    <string name="text_3_for_general_info">The city is divided into Old and New Hamburg by Alsterfleet Channel.
        Above the channel is built Trostbrücke Bridge that is among those rare facilities that have managed to survive in a fire in 1842.
        This bridge features panoramic views of all main sights in Hamburg that always attract visitors by their interesting architectural designs.
        Among these sights are also Town Hall, the oldest Exchange in Germany and the remains of St Nicolas church destroyed during bombings.
        Today these remains are considered an anti-war memorial. No need to say there are many museums, theatres, and libraries in Hamburg. Copyright www.orangesmile.com</string>
